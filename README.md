# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Big Data

# Overview:
 The purpose of this analysis is to determine if paid Vine reviews make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

# Results:

  - There were 7,598 Vine reviews and 1,760,004 non-Vine reviews.
  - There were 2,837 5-stars Vine reviews and 873,722 5-stars non-Vine reviews.
  - There was 37.33 percent of Vine reviews were 5-stars and 49.64 percent of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars.

# Summary:

There seems to be no bias in Vine reviews.  My conclusion is based on the percentage of 5-star reviews. The unpaid non-Vine reviews were much larger than the paid Vine reviews. Therefore, paid Vine reviews did not make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

To make this conclusion stronger I would recommend doing a t-test analysis. Are two groups statistically different?
An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement (2 pt)
